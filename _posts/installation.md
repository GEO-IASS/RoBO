* theano
* matplotlib
* lasagne
* `sgmcmc <https://github.com/stokasto/sgmcmc>`_

Manual Installation
-------------------

To install RoBO first clone the repository:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/automl/RoBO.git

then change into the new directory:

.. code:: bash

    cd RoBO/


Before you install RoBO you have to install the required dependencies

.. code:: bash

    for req in $(cat requirements.txt); do pip install $req; done

This will install the basis requirements that you need to run RoBO's core functionality. If you want to make
use of the full functionality (for instance Bohamiann, Fabolas, ...) you can install all necessary dependencies
by:

.. code:: bash

    for req in $(cat all_requirements.txt); do pip install $req; done


**Note**: This may take a while to install all dependencies.

Finally you can install RoBO by:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install
